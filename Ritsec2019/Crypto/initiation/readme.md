## Write-up

I looked at the hint; and initially thought it was [R'LYEHIAN](https://lingojam.com/RLyehian) because of the C'thulu hint. But the signs from secret.png and the language was nowehere similar. I did some further googling until i stumbled upon [this](https://scottishrite.org/about/media-publications/journal/article/the-copiale-cipher-an-early-german-masonic-ritual-unveiled/) article (Becase of the hints about german and cult). I found used this image to decode secret.png:

And got the sentence: Gruselige kulte und alte Chiffre.
ritsec{Creepy cults and old chipers}
